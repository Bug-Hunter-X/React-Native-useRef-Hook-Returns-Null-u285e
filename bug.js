This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component.  The ref object might be null even after the component has mounted, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to access its current property.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Animated } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const animatedValue = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;

  useEffect(() => {
    Animated.timing(animatedValue, {
      toValue: 1,
      duration: 1000,
    }).start();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Animated.Text style={{ opacity: animatedValue }}>
        Hello!
      </Animated.Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, `animatedValue` might be null if accessed before the `useRef` hook has been fully initialized. Accessing `animatedValue.current` before it is properly initialized will cause a runtime error.
